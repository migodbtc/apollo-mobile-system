To change in documentation (05/04/2025)

1. chapter 1 add delimitation that will say that the EXPO SDK to be used will be 52 in order to opt for the stability instead of the latest features of SDK 53 and up moving forward.
2. chapter 1-3 remove the former member on the page of the paper
3. chapter 1 add delimitation to say that there will be no remote notifications (remote notifications are notifications outside the app) because of the limits from the expo go development, the lack of a proper hosting service, and the variable of making production builds in contrast to development builds.
4. chapter 1 add scope thats say that the mobile application is supportive of local notifications, and would serve as a feature in order to streamline alerts.
5. chapter 1 delimitation add that the project is also dependent on xampp's mysql server, and has a max_packet_allowed variable of 128mb. this would mean that any media over 128mb cannot be allowed into the database for storage reasons.
