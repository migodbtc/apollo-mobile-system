    question: "Why was Apollo developed?",
    answer:
      "Apollo was created to give civilians a platform to easily report fire incidents, for responders to receive real-time information and alerts regarding fire reports, and for system administrators to monitor and connect the two aforementioned parties, streamlining the process of communication and exchange of information between the responders and civilians.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does Apollo's reporting process work?",
    answer:
      "Apollo has a media capture button at the middle of the screen that allows users to take a photo or video of the incident. Once the media is captured, users can preview the media before the report automatically generates relative information such as location and timestamp. Once satisfied, users can submit the report to the system after a short period of time.",
  },
  {
    question: "Who verifies the reports within the system?",
    answer:
      "Apollo includes a verification feature that allows the inclusion of machine learning detection and analysis of reported media within the system. Additionally, responders can view the report and verify themselves if the report is valid or not. This means that not only is there a quick verification process for the responders, but also a supplementary layer of verification through machine learning models.",
  },
  {
    question: "When can I expect my report to be verified?",
    answer:
      "Once the report has been uploaded, it will automatically be queued for verification as a background process. The verification process can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours, depending on the number of reports in the queue and the availability of responders.",
  },
  {
    question: "Who is the main beneficiary of Apollo?",
    answer:
      "The main beneficiary of Apollo is the Daang Bakal Fire Station. Without their help, the developers would have no idea on what best features to include within the application, and their communication is a core foundational factor in the development of system.",
  },
  {
    question: "Who developed Apollo?",
    answer:
      "The development team can be seen below the frequently answered questoins section, with their full names as well as their respective roles in the conception and development of Apollo.",
